    "Since the life sciences by nature involve large data sets generated by experiments,\n",
    "itâ€™s not surprising that artificial intelligence has numerous potential applications in the field\n",
    "Artificial intelligence examples in life sciences include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "The search for novel treatments still requires large-scale experiments and confirmation of hypotheses. \n",
    "However, machine learning has been used since the 1990s to speed the process considerably. It can predict \n",
    "how certain compounds will interact with each other and even how a drug will work against its target.\n",

    "b. Predicting Disease Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have used AI and machine learning extensively to predict the spread and impacts \n",
    "of the virus, particularly as it has mutated. Data from these models has allowed public health and healthcare leaders to\n",
    "adopt policies and prepare resources to minimize spikes and reduce stress on the broader healthcare system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Telecommunications\n",
    "While many of us often take internet and communications availability for granted, the telecommunications industry depends\n",
    "on a series of highly complex processes and constant adjustments. AI can address these needs in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Network Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain flawless operations, networks need to adapt to changing traffic and quickly address anomalies. Currently,\n",
    "63.5% of telecommunications providers are using AI to monitor and improve their networks and deliver the best possible\n",
    "performance for their end customers.\n",
